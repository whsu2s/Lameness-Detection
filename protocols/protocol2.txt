* Title: Data preprocessing: cow detection
* Date: 04.12 to 10.12

* Task
  Improve the result of object detection from last week.
 
* Purpose  
  Make bounding box more accurate and move more smoothly

* Tools
  Python, OpenCV library, and bgslibrary (SuBSENSE)

* Approaches
  1) Background subtraction: Extract the moving objects
  2) Blob detection: Find the contours of the threshold image of the foregorund
  3) Morphological operations: Use erosion and dilation to remove noise, and isolate or join contours
  4) Object detection: Draw bounding box around the maximum contour
  5) Video cropping: Crop the video to remove unwanted content

* Observations/Issues
  1) The SuBSENS performs better than most background subtraction algorithms with a cost of computational cost.
  2) The detection still does not work well when the object is occluded.
  3) Other big objects are also detected, so the threshold of blob area should be modified. 

* Result
  The detection performance is affected by other big objects and occlusion.

* Conclusion
  Even though the SuBSENSE has good background subtraction performance, the object detection still needs to be improved.
