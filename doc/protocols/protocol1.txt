* Title: Data preprocessing: cow detection
* Date: 28.11 to 4.12

* Task
  Detect the main object (cow) in videos
 
* Purpose  
  It is a data preprocessing step to decrease data size and simplify data procssing.

* Tools
  Python and OpenCV library

* Approaches
  1) Background subtraction: Extract the moving objects
  2) Blob detection: Find the contours of the threshold image of the foregorund
  3) Morphological operations: Use erosion and dilation to remove noise, and isolate or join contours
  4) Object detection: Draw bounding box around the maximum contour
  5) Video cropping: Crop the video to remove unwanted content

* Observations/Issues
  1) Cannot play video using cv2.imshow: OpenCV may not been built with FFMPEG support. 
  2) Background subtraction is not efficient to extract the object.
  3) Reflection of the object was treated as part of the object.
  4) The size of output video should be the same as that of the processed frames. 

* Result
  The program can detect the cow in the videos by drawing bounding box, but the performance is unsatisfying if the cow is occluded by the fences or with reflection.

* Conclusion
  Object detection can be achieved by identifying the contours resulted from background subtraction. Further steps may be necessary to get better results.
