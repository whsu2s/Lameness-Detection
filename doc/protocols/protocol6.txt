* Title: Locomotion score regression
* Date: 07.01.19 to 13.01.19

* Tasks
  Train a support vector regression model for locomotion score prediction.
 
* Purpose  
  It is the initial step toward automatic locomotion scoring system.

* Tools
  Python, sklearn toolbox
* Procedures
  1) Define features for data training.
  2) Process data from the labelled video files.
  3) Prepare data for training and testing and apply feature scaling.
  4) Train a support vectir regression (SVR) model using training data.
  5) Test the model using test data.

* Observations/Issues
  1) The data (coordinates of the keypoints) are noisy because the extracted videos are shaky and the location of the keypoints vary from frame to frame.
  2) The test result was poor while the training result was decent. However, there were no extract data to deal with over-fitting. 

* Result
  The test result was poor while the training result was decent.

* Conclusion
  The data is overfitting, so different strategies should be cosidered, such as the features to be used and the amount of data for training.
